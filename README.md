Getting and Cleaning Data
Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


First of all, I merge the training and the test sets to create one data set, then I extract only the measurements on the mean 
and standard deviation for each measurement
Next,use activity names to name the activities in the data set
Finally I create an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
